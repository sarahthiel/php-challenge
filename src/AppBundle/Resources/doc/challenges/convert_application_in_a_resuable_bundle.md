User Story: As a developer I want to convert the App to an independent bundle
==============================================================================
As a developer I want to convert the App to an independent bundle so that is easier to maintain and upgrade.

Task
----
Decouple the current AppBundle from the symfony installation and convert it into a reusable bundle.

AC
--
- The AppBundle is available as an independent bundle (you don't need to add it to packagist:)) 
- All tests are passing
- There is a documentation how to install it.

##Upgrade Symfony Version

###Challenge.
Upgrade the symfony version from 2.8 to a newer version (which is up to you), you should also try upgrade all dependencies, after you are done outline the steps required to modernize the application. 

Note: at some point you might need to upgrade the php version, bumping the alpine image to a higher version should do the trick.

User Story: As a customer I want to see the price of my subscription
====================================================================
As a customer 
I want to see the price of my subscription
So that I know how much money I have to pay.

Task:
-----
Extend the output of the subscription endpoints, so that the price(s) of the subscription is shown. You should show the total price including VAT and shipping costs, and the single prices amount * price, + vat, and shipping costs. The shipping costs depend on the amount of the subscription and are defined per product.

AC:
--
- The prices are visible at the subscription endpoints
- All tests pass.
